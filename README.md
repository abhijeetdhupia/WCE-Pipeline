# Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Pipeline
A one-stop end to end platform to analyze the trails generated by a wireless capsule endoscope. The endoscope frames are first classified as abnormal vs normal, followed by hierarchical tree classification. Subsequently, the abnormal frames are segmented, and their predicted mask is overlayed on the respective image highlighting the abnormal region. 

### Datasets: 
KID datasets are used for training and testing the pipeline. 

### Steps performed by the Pipeline: 

Input: Endoscope video 

Step 0: Video to Frames 

Step 1: Abnormal vs Normal Classification 

Step 2: Hierarchical Tree Classification 

Step 3: Segmentation of the abnormal frames
